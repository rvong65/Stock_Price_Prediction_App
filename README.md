# ðŸ“ˆ Stock Price Prediction App
This is a machine-learning based web application built using Django, React, and TensorFlow. To use the app, the user first starts with signing up for an account by creating a username and a password. The user will then be logged into the main interface where they will need to input a stock ticker and a date in the future. A text box will then appear that will display a predicted price for that date.
